# E-commerce_WebScraping
This is a Project in which I have scrapped the data from different different websites such as Product type, Product Prize, Product Ratings etc. to visualize and see which is Platform is better for online Shopping.   
After scrapping the data I used Microsoft PowerBI for finding out insights from the data.

I made this project previously (3-4 months ago) but I am uploading it right now.
